Our site is currently online and can be seen by following the link below:

http://carlofer.pythonanywhere.com/finalproject/Home/

Feel free to navigate through it :)

However, if you still want to launch the site through a local server, this must be done from inside the 
'projectweb' folder (>> python manage.py runserver --noreload). Once done, go to 

http://127.0.0.1:8000/finalproject/Home/ 

And click around!

Also:

- Our django project name is 'projectweb'
- Our app name is 'finalproject'. This folder is located inside the main 'projectweb' folder. 
- Inside the 'finalproject' folder, one should find 'views.py', 'urls.py', 'forms.py', 'modules.py', etc. with 
all the relevant code for the site.
- One should also find the .html templates at ~/finalproject/templates and the static files at 
~/finalproject/static/finalproject.

The raw data bases and python scripts that clean this raw data & generate the merged data bases 
we use in our ap, are located in the 'DATA' folder. For a better understanding of these data and scripts, 
please read the documentation in 'Data_explained.txt'.
