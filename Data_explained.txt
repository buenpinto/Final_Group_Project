FOLDER: projectweb

"projectweb" is the name of the django project created. 
Inside this folder, we can find our app folder ("finalproject") 
and all the corresponding django files (views.py, urls.py, etc.)
and related folders (templates, static, etc.)


FOLDER: DATA

This folder contains the raw data used to generate the
data bases and maps (.png images) used on the project. 
That is, it contains 4 cross sectional Casen surveys 
with selected variables; a data base (i.e. COUNTY_CODES.csv) 
that contains the name of each county with its county ID 
(the identifier used in the surveys); a shapefile indicating
the county divisions in Chile. This are, for each year: 

-Casen_2006.csv
-Casen_2009.csv
-Casen_2011.csv
-Casen_2013.csv

-COUNTY_CODES.csv


The folder also contains some python scripts, that were used to:

(i)  - merge_all.py --> merge and clean all the Casen surveys (2006 to 2013)
(ii) - editCasen2013.py --> import some extra variables from the Casen_2013.csv 
                            file to use on our "Cross sectional" section. (see 
			    "display_cross_sectional" and "cross_sectional2013" 
			    views on views.py)
(iii) - gis.py -->       generates a map of Chile as "map_county_code.png" that shows the given 
		         county (the "selected" county) in a different color.
(iv) - gis_region.py --> generates regional cloropleth maps of Chile (i.e. one for each region)
			 showing income distribution within each region (quintiles of income)		

We also have in this folder the output data from the previous scripts:

- Casen_all_final.csv --> merged data base; output from merge_all.py
- Casen_all_final_edit.csv --> same as Casen_all_final.csv, but without some characters 
			      (á,é,í,ó, ú, ñ) that were causing import problems with the 
			       "join(settings.STATIC_ROOT,.." instruction in django
- Casen_2013_vars.csv --> cleaned Casen2013 data base with additional education and 
			  employment level variables(used on our "Cross sectional" section). 


Finally, the folder "Maps" inside the DATA folder contains the county and regional maps generated
by the gis.py and gis_region.py scripts.
